# Integrative Analysis of MRI-Based Segmentation and Molecular Characterization in Intracranial Tumors

## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive framework for the multimodal analysis of intracranial tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and molecular profiling. By leveraging deep learning for precise tumor segmentation and integrating multi-omics data, the approach aims to improve diagnostic stratification, guide clinical decision-making, and support the development of precision oncology strategies for patients with brain tumors.

## Tumor Types Investigated

The analysis focuses on five major intracranial tumor types:

- **Glioma** (including glioblastoma and low-grade gliomas)
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary adenomas**
- **Intracranial lesions** (non-neoplastic or inflammatory)
- **Schwannoma**

These tumor types vary in biological aggressiveness, imaging characteristics, and molecular signatures, necessitating individualized diagnostic and treatment approaches.

## Objectives

- To construct an automated MRI segmentation pipeline capable of delineating tumor subregions with high precision using patient-level data.
- To correlate radiological imaging features with underlying molecular alterations, including gene expression, mutations, and copy number variations.
- To explore tumor heterogeneity and identify molecular biomarkers relevant to patient prognosis and therapy selection.

## Patient Data and Sources

- **Imaging Data**: Patient-level MRI scans (T1-weighted, T2, FLAIR, T1-contrast) sourced from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com), a curated platform for computer vision datasets, and preprocessed according to clinical standards for volumetric analysis.
- **Molecular Data**: Matched transcriptomic and genomic data obtained from the NIH/NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC), specifically from the TCGA-GBM and TCGA-LGG cohorts. Data includes somatic mutations, gene expression profiles (RNA-Seq), and copy number alterations.

All patient data was de-identified in accordance with HIPAA regulations and used under open-access research data agreements.

## Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing

- Co-registration and spatial normalization of multimodal MRI sequences.
- Standardization using MONAI pipelines for consistency across patient datasets.

### 2. Segmentation

- Implementation of a U-Net architecture trained on manually annotated brain tumor regions from the BRaTS challenge dataset.
- Application of reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and PPO) to enhance segmentation performance and reduce clinical false negatives, especially in infiltrative tumor margins.

### 3. Molecular Association

- Post-segmentation spatial analysis to extract tumor volume, edema, necrosis, and enhancing core features.
- Integration with omics data using machine learning models (random forest, XGBoost) and unsupervised clustering (t-SNE, k-means) to uncover imaging-genomic associations.
- Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways enriched in specific imaging phenotypes.

## Key Findings

- Reinforcement learning led to measurable improvements in Dice coefficient scores across tumor subregions, enhancing reliability for clinical use.
- Spatial imaging features such as peritumoral edema volume showed significant correlation with molecular subtypes (e.g., IDH mutation, MGMT methylation status).
- Identified gene signatures associated with radiologic aggressiveness, which may serve as non-invasive prognostic biomarkers.

## Clinical Implications

This integrative framework demonstrates the feasibility of linking radiographic phenotypes with molecular traits at the patient level. Such an approach may facilitate:

- **Non-invasive molecular subtyping**
- **Treatment stratification** based on imaging-molecular correlations
- **Monitoring tumor progression or therapeutic response**
